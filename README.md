# Blackfynn Filter Project

This project is a simple filter application that allows you to search through a list of users. User would filter on first name
and/or last name to see their desired results.

This project was build using angular-seed runs on NodeJS. I used AngularJS 1.7 For the front-end/UI design, I opted to use the Bulma framework for its
ease of use and flexibility with mobile design.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply clone the git repo and run 'npm install' to install all the node dependencies included in the project.

Once that's done, simply run the project by typing 'npm start' in your terminal and go to http://localhost:8000/#!/filter to see the application.
